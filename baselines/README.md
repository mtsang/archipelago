# Baseline Methods

This directory provides baseline methods primarily used by ArchAttribute experiments. Our ArchDetect experiments also use some of these baselines.

For specialized baseline methods, we tried to use the original implementation as much as possible. For other baseline methods, we either implemented them ourselves or used public re-implementations.
